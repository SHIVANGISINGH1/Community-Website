This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### For adding pages:
You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. We will add more pages in future according to our requirement. You can learn more about it from the [official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).

### For adding styles to the app
You can add stylesheets to different pages and components or use a global css file. 
[Read the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) to learn more about the different css-support in next js 

### For adding the API routes
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
